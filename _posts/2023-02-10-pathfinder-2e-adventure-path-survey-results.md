A few days ago I posted a [short survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/10wdzzq/adventure_path_rating_survey/) on Reddit asking Pathfinder 2e players and GMs to rate each of the 10 published Adventure Paths on a simple 1-5 scale. At the time of writing, I have received 60 responses to the survey which amount to a total of 222 Adventure Path ratings. I’m publishing the initial data here but I will leave the survey open to continue to collect more responses. If you’d like to contribute your own ratings you can fill out the survey [here](https://forms.gle/4NrTv6gQsdvNPDKw5). No personal data is collected as part of this survey, just your responses to the questions.

The data below is broken down by Adventure Path and sorted from the lowest average rating to the highest. I wanted to keep the focus of this post on the results of my survey, but I will be writing up a more comprehensive post in which I will rank the Adventure Paths based on data pulled from several sources across the internet (including this survey).

Note - Shortly after posting my survey I realized that Reddit user u/DuncanBaxter had posted [a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/zq6dao/pathfinder_2e_adventure_path_survey_results/) on Reddit a couple of months prior to mine. Their survey is far more detailed and [the results](https://imgur.com/a/30NNbSB) are well worth reading through. They also used the results to create [a fantastic guide](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wM84QWch-adventures) to help people pick the right Adventure Path for them - I love the idea of making each Adventure Path into a stat block. Go check it out!

# Comparing Surveys

As I mentioned above, u/DuncanBaxter also recently published a survey about Pathfinder 2e Adventure Paths. Their survey was far more comprehensive, but they did include a question asking players “How do you rate your overall enjoyment of the adventures you have experienced?” That seemed fairly close to the premise of my survey so, out of curiosity, I adjusted their data for that question to fit a 1-5 scale and compared their results to mine. 

| Adventure Path | ILootTheBody (222 Ratings) | DuncanBaxter (893 Ratings) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abomination Vaults | 4.07 | 4.00 |
| Age of Ashes | 3.14 | 3.40 |
| Agents of Edgewatch | 3.13 | 3.30 |
| Blood Lords | 3.67 | 3.90 |
| Extinction Curse | 2.37 | 3.00 |
| Fists of the Ruby Phoenix | 3.56 | 3.85 |
| Kingmaker | 4.00 | 4.15 |
| Outlaws of Alkenstar | 3.47 | 3.60 |
| Quest for the Frozen Flame | 3.59 | 3.70 |
| Strength of Thousands | 4.08 | 4.10 |


Overall, the results seem to line up fairly well considering the large discrepancy in our sample sizes. The scores for my survey were generally lower than theirs and our final rankings don’t line up exactly one-to-one, but they are relatively close. Our three top rated and three bottom rated Adventure Paths are the same, just in slightly different orders.
